                    <p>Professor at UFSC, specializing in CMOS design and modeling.</p>
                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>Carlos Galup-Montoro studied engineering sciences at the University of the Republic, Montevideo, Uruguay, and electronic engineering at the National Polytechnic School of Grenoble (INPG), France. He received an engineering degree in electronics in 1979 and a doctorate degree in 1982, both from INPG. From 1982 to 1989 he was with the University of São Paulo, Brazil, where he was engaged in junction field effect transistor (JFET) fabrication and analog circuit design.<br>Since 1990, he has been with the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil where he is now a professor. From August 1997 to February 1998 he was a research associate with the Analog Mixed Signal Group, Texas A&M University. From August 2008 to July 2009 he was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley. His main research interests and expertise are in field effect transistor and sensor modeling and analog and mixed signal circuit design.</p>
